# The Basics

My name is **Alvaro Balbin**. I grew up between Spain and Turkey in a very international environment, which taught me to adapt quickly and move comfortably across cultures. I speak Spanish, English, German and Turkish, and I’m currently learning Italian.

I build because I like taking something that doesn’t exist, breaking it down piece by piece, learning what I need and making it real. The moment I understood the world was built by people no smarter than us, I knew I wanted to contribute something of my own.

I’m drawn to **systems that interact with reality**: machine learning models deployed end-to-end, embedded systems, perception and control, and tools that make people faster and more capable. I care about things that **ship, run and matter**.

I work best in **small, high-speed teams** where ownership is clear and decisions happen fast. I don’t enjoy environments that avoid risk or bury momentum in process. I prefer teams that try things, test quickly and learn by doing.

Long-term, I want to help build or lead a **zero-to-one product** with real technical depth. I eventually want to either join a founding team or build my own company and push something valuable into the world.

### How I Work

**Gets me pumped:**  
Creating something I have no idea how to build at first, figuring it out fast, and getting it working end-to-end in the real world.

**Disappoints me:**  
Low signal-to-noise behaviour, and environments where people avoid risk or avoid ownership.

**Strengths:**  
I learn very fast and adapt quickly in fast-moving, high-pressure situations. I take ownership without needing direction and I have the grit to keep pushing when things get difficult.

**Improvement points:**  
Reducing workload and focusing deeply on one track at a time instead of running too many in parallel.

**Comms style:**  
Straight to the point, clear and collaborative. I ask questions early, move fast, and prefer honest and direct communication over HR-speak.

## Some Personal Stuff

I compete in **powerlifting** and I’m currently training for BUCS in May with a target 600kg total.  
I also run regularly. My 5k is **under 20 minutes** and my 4k is **around 13 minutes**. (Strava available.)

I’m **Catholic** and take that seriously. It shapes how I think about discipline, purpose and responsibility.  
I’m very proud of being **Spanish**. I believe our culture teaches courage, loyalty and joy, and that societies are better when people take real risks.

I read a lot. Some big influences:  
• **Seneca and the Stoics**  
• **Thomas Aquinas** and Christian philosophy  
• **Michio Kaku** and physics writing  
• **Rudyard Kipling** (The Five Nations has stayed with me)

My favorite book is **The Godfather** by Mario Puzo.  
I’m also planning to read **The Count of Monte Cristo** soon.

Music matters to me. I like **jazz and rock**, especially **Sting** and **Scorpions**.  
I also listen to **rap (Biggie)** and older **Spanish music**.  
My favorite song is **Libre** by Nino Bravo.


## My Vision

In 5 years, I see myself building alongside people who are **sharp, ambitious and serious about creating new things**, not just talking about them.

The Exponential Fellowship aligns with that. I want proximity to people who think boldly, move fast and are willing to bet on themselves. I want to be in rooms where decisions matter and where what we build has real impact.
